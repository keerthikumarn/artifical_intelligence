File handling is an import part of programming which allows us to create, read, update and delete files. In Python to handle data we use open() built-in function.

read(): read the whole text as string. If we want to limit the number of characters we want to read, we can limit it by passing int value to the read(number) method.

readline(): read only the first line
readlines(): read all the text line by line and returns a list of lines
